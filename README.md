# PV-array-Fault-Classification
Machine learning–based classification of PV array fault conditions using current and voltage features, implemented with Decision Tree and Random Forest models.
## Fault Types
- NO Fault
- Line A to Ground Fault
- Line B to Line C Fault
- Line A Line B to Ground Fault
- Line A Line B Line C
- Line A Line B Line C to Ground Fault

## Dataset
The dataset contains current and voltage measurements (Ia, Ib, Ic, Va, Vb, Vc) along with binary fault indicators (G, C, B, A).

## Models
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

## Evaluation
Models are evaluated using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.
